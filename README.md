# Python3-openCV-face-recognition-example
Python3 face recognition example based on openCv library. MS Visual Studio project.

Three of best ever actors has been chosen for training and recognition. Their photos located in a trainigData and checkingData folders. Face recognition and creation of faces base are being done in [faceRecog.py](https://github.com/Nonmant/Python3-openCV-face-recognition-example/blob/master/faceRecog/faceRecog.py) script. Determition of face's owner is being done in [faceRecogPredict.py](https://github.com/Nonmant/Python3-openCV-face-recognition-example/blob/master/faceRecog/faceRecogPredict.py) script.
